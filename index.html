    <p>
      <strong>Comfort zone</strong>: the boundaries of your current experience
      and capabilities where you operate on autopilot, relying on established
      routines and habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Growth zone</strong>: state of constructive discomfort where you
      transform potential into reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unrealized potential</strong>: impossible tasks that you
      <em>could</em> achieve if you overcome the obstacles preventing you from
      doing so.

      Let's view an example to see how our comfort zone grows or shrinks over
      time. Scroll down to the end and watch how choosing to do things outside
      your comfort zone affect you.
    </p>
    <div class="narrative"></div>
    <p>
      But the opposite is also true! Scroll back up to see your comfort zone
      shrink if you decided not to try these new things.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't conciously try new things outside of your comfort zone, your
      world shrinks, and you limit your potential.
